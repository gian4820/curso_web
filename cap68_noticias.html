  <h2>UFC 236 ‘HOLLOWAY VS. POIRIER 2’</h2>

  <p class="space">UFC 236 goes down on Saturday in Atlanta,
    and in a circumstance that is now par for the course,
    the Ultimate Fighting Championship will crown two
    champions in weight classes that already have champions.
    On the other hand, regardless of what you think
    of interim titles, it doesn’t mean you can’t bet
    on the proceedings.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the caveat that this still figures to be an absolute war and
    that Poirier figures to have his moments, this fight should mostly
    take place on the feet, and there is probably not a fighter in his
    weight range who can beat Holloway there. This latest version of
    Poirier does a great job of setting a range and picking apart his
    opponents, but unlike Gaethje and Alvarez, Holloway does not figure
    to let himself get hit. From there, it figures to be Holloway who
    gets a better read on the fight and manages to win rounds through volume.

  <h2>THE FILM ROOM: ISRAEL ADESANYA</h2>

  <p class="space">“The Last Stylebender” on Saturday will confront
    Kelvin Gastelum in the UFC 236 co-main event,
    where the fate of the interim middleweight
    championship hangs in the balance.
  </p>

  <p>Holloway’s UFC tenure started innocuously enough. As a ridiculously
    raw prospect just barely out of his teens, the Hawaiian stepped in
    on short notice and got absolutely dominated by a much more
    experienced Poirier. After a rough first two years full of
    prospect losses -- even if those losses were coming to fighters
    like Poirier and McGregor -- Holloway started 2014 with a win over
    Will Chope and has not looked back since, going undefeated over 13
    fights and five years. It is as amazing a run as there is in the
    sport, as Holloway went from something like an Anthony Pettis
    starter kit to one of the most diverse and violent boxers in
    the game, feeling out opponent after opponent and marching through
    hell to put on the pressure. </p>
